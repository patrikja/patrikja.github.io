Today I gave an invited presentation at the
[Alan Turing Institute](https://turing.ac.uk/)
[Symposium on Reproducibility for Data Intensive Research](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whats-on/upcoming-events/2016/april/reproducibility-symposium).


The title was "Reproducibility, Proofs and Domain Specific Languages"
and
[slides](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~patrikj/talks/Jansson_Reproducibility_DSL.pdf),
[source](Jansson_Reproducibility_DSL.md) and
["script"](Jansson_Reproducibility_DSL_script.md) are available in
[a new repository](https://github.com/patrikja/CoeGSS) for "my part"
of the [CoeGSS](http://coegss.eu/).

The symposium brought together computer scientists, other researchers,
librarians, publishers, data experts, etc. for two intensive days of
talks and break-out sessions on different aspects of Reproducibility.

The participant included a number of active tweeters so here is the twitter view of the symposium:
